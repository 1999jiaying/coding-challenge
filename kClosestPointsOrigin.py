challenge: https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/
question: Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k,
return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).The distance between two points on the X-Y plane
is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
idea: calculate the distance and then sort.
